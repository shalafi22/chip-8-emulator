# Chip-8 Emulator
**WIP!!**
## What is this?

This is a small practice project that aims to emulate a Chip-8 device. For more info on Chip-8: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8

## How to use?

Although it is still under construction, the emulator can be used:\n
    1. I am not sharing the executable yet, you have to have rustc installed on your device.\n
    2. Download this repo and compile it with rustc\n
    3. At the time of writing, the .ch8 file is hard-coded to ./roms/maze.ch8\n
    4. Get a .ch8 binary under this path to get it working\n

## Requirements:

Appropriate SDL2 libraries must be installed for the SDL2 dependency to work correctly.

A set of demo .ch8 binaries can be found here: https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms
